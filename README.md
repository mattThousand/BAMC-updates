BAMC allows you to record hip hop tracks inside of your browser levaraging the awesomness of the Web Audio Api, recorder.js
and tuna.js
Right now, it is only available within desktop chrome and opera but with the arrival of Firefox 23 and Safari 7, will be
more available.
To get started click on record and allow chrome access to your microphone then go crazy. Your tracks are stored with S3 and
can be shared with friends on facebook and twitter as well as downloaded for you own personal use.

If you find a bug or can think of an awesome feature don't hesitate to fork BAMC and make a pull request.
